# Contributing to OpenMaterials

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This guide summarizes how
contributions work here. For the full governance model and change process, see
[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

## Licensing of contributions

This project uses two licenses:

- **Code** (for example, the `omai/` package) is licensed under the
  **Apache License, Version 2.0**. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).
- **Map data** (for example, `map/`, `docs/data/`, and `index/`) is licensed
  under **CC BY 4.0**. See [LICENSE-DATA](LICENSE-DATA).

When you contribute code, you contribute it under Apache-2.0. When you
contribute to the map or other data, you contribute it under CC BY 4.0.

## No CLA, no copyright assignment

This project does **not** require a Contributor License Agreement and does
**not** ask you to assign copyright. Contributors retain ownership of their
contributions; they are simply licensed to the project (and to everyone) under
the applicable license above.

## Attribution

Credit is part of the infrastructure of this project. When you add or map an
external code, dataset, or result, include the citation, DOI, license, and
source URL as the existing entries in `docs/data/codes.json` do. Do not remove
or alter existing attribution, copyright, or license notices. Register a code
release by appending it to `docs/data/releases/<representation>.json` with its
tag, commit and date, and the license read at that tag, then run
`python -m omai.map_data` and `python -m omai.index_data`. A registered release
is never edited or removed.

## Change process

Changes to the map are recorded by appending to `map/log.jsonl` and pass through
the review gates described in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md). Please read that
document before proposing map changes.

## Code of Conduct

Participation in this project is governed by our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
