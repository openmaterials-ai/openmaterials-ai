"""Enforcement: every code rail on the map is cited and licensed.

Giuseppe's rule: every code we represent must carry a citation (paper / DOI)
and its license. This test is the "remember" mechanism. It discovers every
rail actually present on the map (every representation_name that build_codes
emits) and fails if any rail lacks a CODE_CREDITS entry, has an empty citation
or license, or carries license "UNKNOWN" without an explicit waiver below.
A future rail therefore cannot land uncredited: adding an adapter without a
credits entry breaks this test.
