"""Tests for the index registry generator and instance uid pinning (kernel P3).

The `index/codes/` entries pin each representation's coverage to the store
HEAD at generation time: one file per representation, each covered node
carrying its live node uid, the whole file stamped with the map version read
from the committed store's head (decision: head-at-generation; the map_version
field is the version the coverage was computed against, which advances past
the frozen genesis as contributions land). Instances gain a `node_uid` at
bundle time, resolved from the live identity of the variable they name
(additive; existing keys untouched).
