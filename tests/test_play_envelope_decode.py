"""The playground's envelope decode agrees with the python reference.

The page's dual read (docs/play/index.html: b64urlToObj + normalizeEnvelope)
and omai/lineages.py envelope_from_fragment must speak the same wire: a
python-minted multi-lineage bundle fragment decodes on the page to the same
member count, ids, and doc source, and a legacy single-record fragment still
decodes (normalized to a one-element envelope), forever.

Follows the test_run_url_configuration_param.py technique: extract the page's
top-level functions by brace matching and run them under Node against real
fragments minted by the python reference. Skipped cleanly when Node (or its
DecompressionStream, needed for the gzip fragment) is unavailable; a static
wiring check guards the feature regardless.
