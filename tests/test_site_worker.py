"""The site Worker serves the static site untouched and adds only the named
dynamic routes.

infra/site is the edge deployment of the SAME docs/ every browser reads:
wrangler serves docs/ as assets and the Worker script runs only for
/l/<id> (the short-link resolver; a value's canonical URL is its /i/<id>/
page) and /healthz. These tests pin the
contract statically and, where node is available, run the Worker's pure
resolver logic against the real committed projection.
