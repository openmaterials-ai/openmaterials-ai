"""Dimension evaluation over sympy expressions (kernel P1 dimensional gate).

Given a curated per-domain registry of `symbol base name -> Dimension`
(populated at import time, like the vocabulary registry), `dimension_of`
computes the physical dimension of a sympy expression by structural
recursion, returning None whenever any symbol it needs is unknown. Unknown
means *skip*, never guess: the report treats a None as SKIPPED rather than
inventing a dimension.

Two things are proven, not guessed, and raise `DimensionalViolation`:
  * an `Add` of two summands whose dimensions are both known and differ;
  * a known-dimensionful argument to a transcendental (`exp`, `log`,
    `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`) or to the Bose-Einstein occupation
    `n_{BE}(...)`.
Equality of two `Eq` sides is compared by the *caller* (see
`dimensional_report`), not inside `dimension_of`.

Opaque dimensions in a lookup are treated as unknown (None); the algebra
never runs on an opaque dimension.

The registry is seeded per domain (see
`omai/thermal_transport/operator/dimensions_registry.py` and
`omai/materials/operator/dimensions_registry.py`), imported for side
effect next to each domain's vocabulary module.
