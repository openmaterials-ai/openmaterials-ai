"""Physical dimensions for the operator layer.

The operator layer is unit-free (Principle 2): observables and
parameters carry a *dimension* but no unit choice. Units appear only on
representations, declared by adapters.

A Dimension is no longer a flat name-tag: it carries an exponent vector
over the seven SI base dimensions (M, L, T, Theta, N, I, J), with an
opaque escape hatch (exponents = None) for deliberately unmodeled
internals (Potential, Structure, Trajectory fields, the ACF kinds typed
OPAQUE). Multiplication, division, and integer powers compose the
exponents; equality and hash go by exponents (opaque dimensions compare
by name). Every existing named constant keeps its exact name and its call
sites, so serialized data that writes `dimension.name` is unaffected.

The `canonical()` string is the deterministic base-ordered rendering of
the exponents; it becomes part of node identity in kernel P2, so its form
must stay stable (fixed base order, fixed-length integer exponents).
