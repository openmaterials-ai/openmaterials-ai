"""Symbol-vocabulary registry for the formula free-symbol discipline.

`validate_dag` checks every free symbol in an edge's sympy formula against
a declared vocabulary: the symbols carried by the edge's input and output
spaces, the edge's declared parameters, and a pool of permitted bare
constants. This module holds that vocabulary as a *registry* which each
domain populates at import time (see
`omai/thermal_transport/operator/vocabulary.py` and
`omai/materials/operator/vocabulary.py`), so the core layer stays free of
domain-specific names and a new domain extends validation coverage by
registering, never by editing core.

Only truly generic content is seeded here: thermodynamic constants any
formula may reference and the plain dummy indices used across domains.
Everything tied to a physical setting (BZ meshes, MD timesteps, provided-
source placeholders, ...) belongs to the domain that owns it.

The registered symbol sets are validation vocabulary, not identity: they
never enter a node's type and are free to grow without re-minting anything.
