"""Protocol registries: the controlled vocabularies that enter content hashes.

Kernel P2 makes a node's identity a content hash over its quantity tag, field
signatures (dimension + index-kind signature), gauge class, and labels; an
edge's identity adds the formula fingerprint and the schemes. Every *string*
that enters such a hash must be drawn from a controlled, versioned registry
rather than a free-form value, so that two contributors converge by mapping to
the same registered token and cross-domain identity is meaningful (a `qpoint`
means the same kind in every domain). This module holds the four registries:

  INDEX_KINDS   index NAME -> index KIND (atom, cartesian, qpoint, ...).
  QUANTITY_TAGS curated quantity tag -> one-line description.
  GAUGE_GROUPS  gauge-group identifier -> description (ascii, six in use).
  LABEL_KEYS    semantic label key -> frozenset of allowed values.

decisions" #1 and #3.
