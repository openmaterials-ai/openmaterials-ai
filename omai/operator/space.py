"""Operator nodes (spaces) of the DAG.

Two concrete kinds, both inheriting from `Space`:

  ObservableSpace  — a gauge-invariant first-class node. Cross-code agreement
                     is REQUIRED at this node (after spec-derived unit and
                     normalization conversion). The operator layer's compare()
                     returns pass/fail verdicts here.

  HiddenSpace      — an adapter-internal, gauge-dependent operator node. Not
                     cross-code comparable per-element. Useful as a name for
                     computational scaffolding (per-mode arrays in a basis-
                     dependent representation, intermediate sums) that an
                     adapter produces on its way to an ObservableSpace, but
                     whose per-element content is determined by gauge / basis /
                     summation choices that the operator layer does not pin
                     down. compare() on a HiddenSpace without a contraction
                     returns status=NOT_COMPARABLE.

Each `Space` carries a tuple of `Field`s — typed slots declaring the named
quantities (with dimension and index signature) the representation holds.
