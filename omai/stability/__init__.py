"""The stability domain: FormationEnergy, EnergyAboveHull, SurfaceEnergy,
Voltage, AdsorptionEnergy, ReactionEnergy, GrainBoundaryEnergy.

Phase stability and electrochemistry from the pymatgen scan (AtomisticSkills,
arXiv 2605.24002): the per-atom formation energy against elemental references,
its distance to the convex hull, the per-facet surface energy, and the average
intercalation voltage. All four are energy differences over the per-cell
TotalEnergy the ground-state domain already carries; the per-atom quantities
are DISTINCT nodes from TotalEnergy (the scan's highest-risk trap: pymatgen's
energy_per_atom / formation_energy_per_atom / e_above_hull are per-atom
currencies that never map to the per-cell node).

The matcalc/ASE scan (arXiv 2605.24002) added AdsorptionEnergy (2026-07-10):
the surface-energetics kin of SurfaceEnergy, an extensive (per-configuration,
NOT per-atom) energy difference E_adslab - E_slab - E_adsorbate, driven by
mat-surface-adsorption via matcalc AdsorptionCalc.

The config-thermo scan (arXiv 2605.24002) added ReactionEnergy (2026-07-10):
the stoichiometric energy of a balanced solid-state reaction, combined from the
per-atom formation energies of reactants and products via rxn_network.

The characterization scan (arXiv 2605.24002) added GrainBoundaryEnergy
(2026-07-10, records 181-182): the sibling of SurfaceEnergy on the same
energy-per-area dimension, the CSL-slab-minus-bulk excess over twice the
boundary area (pymatgen GrainBoundaryGenerator CSL slabs plus an MLIP relax),
with the boundary configuration (Sigma, tilt, axis, GB plane) in conditions.

Two candidates the matcalc/ASE scan deferred have since landed in their own
domains: the QHA finite-T thermodynamics (Gibbs G(T), thermal expansion
alpha(T), Cp(T)) landed as the quasiharmonic domain (2026-07-10) via the
phonopy PhonopyQHA route; the NEB barrier (chem-neb-barrier via ase.mep)
landed as the molecular ReactionBarrier[construction=neb_mep] (2026-07-10), and
solid-state migration barriers as MigrationBarrier (2026-10-05).

Deferred candidates from the scan's new-node list, each with why:

  * XRD pattern I(2theta) and Raman intensity I(omega): function-valued
    characterization signals; they need a spectrum type (an axis-and-values
    representation with binning semantics) the operator layer does not have
    yet. High value, wrong shape for a scalar-node slice.
  * Defect formation energy E_f: needs the chemical-potential machinery
    (reservoir choices, charge states, Freysoldt corrections) as first-class
    schemes; the committed examples span neutral and charged conventions
    that must not be merged silently.
  * Bare energy-per-atom: subsumed, deliberately not a node: it is
    TotalEnergy / N_atoms, a normalization of an existing quantity, not a
    distinct physical quantity (unlike the formation energy, which also
    subtracts elemental references).
