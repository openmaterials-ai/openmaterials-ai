"""Deterministic, kernel-powered validation (no LLM).

Every surviving MAP claim must clear these gates:

  - node resolves: the mapped variable is a live node in docs/data/graph.json
    (uid-pinned via the same name->uid bridge the instance bundler uses);
  - unit sane: the printed unit maps to a registered unit whose dimension
    matches the node's field dimension, OR is a soft note when the printed unit
    cannot be resolved (many real printed spellings are not tokens of the unit
    registry, omai.representation.units.UNITS); a dimensional MISMATCH is a
    hard kill;
  - value finite: the numeric value is a real, finite number;
  - quote VERIFIED: the cited_text appears, after normalization, as a substring
    of the extracted PDF text. A claim whose quote is not present DIES here.
    This is the hallucination gate.
  - not a delta: the quote does not frame the value as a difference/change of
    the mapped quantity ("a 0.6 W/mK drop of kappa" is a delta, not a value);
  - not a descriptive spectral marker: a Frequency-family quote does not frame
    the value as a prose band edge / threshold ("below 4 THz") rather than a
    measured peak. These two are code-level kills for cases the LLM reviewer
    does not reliably catch; both are deliberately conservative.
  - duplicate: (node uid + material + approx value) already present in
    docs/data/instances/ -> flagged duplicate (already on the map).

The quote gate is the one that proves the pipeline is honest: no claim survives
without a verbatim, page-located quote from the document.
