"""The formalization roadmap: every operator rated by what proving it needs.

Companion to the lean exports. Each operator's formula is classified by the
mathematics a Lean proof of it would take:

- ``easy``: a genuinely rational identity (a nontrivial denominator to clear);
  the generator proves these outright, so they appear in
  ``OpenMaterialsIdentities.lean`` and carry ``proven: true``.
- ``trivial``: a polynomial definition; after substitution the statement is
  reflexive, so a theorem would certify nothing. Deliberately not emitted.
- ``hard``: the formula needs analysis (a sum over modes, an integral, a
  derivative, or a special function); provable in principle, but by hand,
  not by a generator tactic.
- ``na``: the right-hand side names an external code's output (an opaque
  function symbol) or the edge carries no formula; there is nothing
  algebraic to prove, only the dimension and the lineage.

The website renders ``docs/data/lean_roadmap.json``. The counts are an honest
statement of the frontier, not a coverage claim: ``hard`` and ``na`` rows say
plainly what a proof would take and why none is shipped.
