r"""ORCA (molecular quantum chemistry) adapter specs.

ORCA 6.1 as the AtomisticSkills orca-agent skills drive it (arXiv 2605.24002,
anchored in scans/orca-atomistic-skills.json, 18 entries, deep-review verified
2026-07-10). ORCA is a proprietary binary (not pip-installable), so every
quantity claim anchors to a committed skill file:line: the three
chem-dft-orca-{singlepoint,optimization,advanced-calculation} skills, the shared
src/utils/dft/orca_utils.py, and the pure-regex parse_orca_output.py that reads
ORCA .out files. This is the map's FIRST molecular rail.

The per-MOLECULE basis (the ruling). ORCA's TotalEnergy is the EXACT SAME
TotalEnergy node the periodic codes ground, distinct only by a required
provenance label: the spec notes carry (basis=per_molecule,
electron_treatment=all_electron, functional, basis_set, dispersion, solvation) and
the FORBIDDEN CROSS-SUBSTRATE SUBTRACTION rule. ORCA is all-electron (or ECP)
with an atom-centered Gaussian basis; its energy zero is the isolated-atoms /
all-electron reference, NOT the pseudopotential zero of QE/VASP nor the MLIP
atom_refs zero, so an ORCA molecular total and a periodic cell total are on
DIFFERENT absolute scales and must NEVER be subtracted across codes.

Unit and provenance traps this module pins (all review-verified against scipy
CODATA):

  * HARTREE everywhere. ORCA reports Hartree (Eh) natively for ALL energies;
    HARTREE_TO_EV = 27.211386245988 (hardcoded parse_orca_output.py:32, inline at
    run_orca_input.py:93, su.EV_PER_HARTREE at orca_utils.py:27). The map serves
    eV. Forces: Hartree/bohr * HARTREE_TO_EV * BOHR_PER_ANGSTROM -> eV/A
    (run_singlepoint.py:137), the Ry_per_bohr-analog conversion.
  * The final_energy DLPNO / DFT collision: the 'FINAL SINGLE POINT ENERGY' regex
    is method-blind. ORCA writes that header for DFT, DLPNO-CCSD(T), and CASSCF
    alike, all keyed final_energy; a correlated CCSD(T) total and a DFT total
    share the key but are DIFFERENT physics. The method string is provenance.
  * Basis-set provenance is the checkpoint analog: def2-SVP / PBE defaults are
    low-accuracy; results ride on (functional, basis_set, dispersion, solvation,
    special_option). wB97M-V needs a documented hack for any hyphenated functional
    (--functional '' --dispersion '' --special_option wB97M-V, SKILL.md:98-101).
  * Dispersion is folded into the method string (method = f'{functional}-
    {dispersion}', orca_utils.py:160-161) AND parsed separately
    (dispersion_correction_hartree); it is part of the reported total, not
    additive on top.
  * Solvation: --solvation requires --solvent (orca_utils.py:146-150); the
    solvated single point returns the ordinary energy tagged with
    solvation/solvent, NO G_solv difference is computed. Solvated runs ride
    TotalEnergy provenance (SolvationFreeEnergy deferred: no skill computes the
    gas-minus-solvated difference).
  * Thermochemistry (ZPE, enthalpy, Gibbs, entropy correction) is parsed in
    Hartree->eV per-molecule (parse_orca_output.py:127-147); the entropy member is
    the T*S PRODUCT in energy units, NOT the entropy S (divide by temperature_K
    for S). The molecular RRHO thermochemistry BUNDLE is deferred (it needs the
    MolecularFrequency node first).

Molecular frequencies (a NODE this slice, physics review 2026-07-10). ORCA emits
the 3N-6 normal-mode wavenumbers in cm^-1 (parse_orca_output.py:102, key
frequencies_cm1; imaginary modes printed NEGATIVE cm^-1; n_imaginary 0=min,
1=transition state) with per-mode IR intensities in km/mol (a predicted IR stick
spectrum, consumed by chem-spectrum-matcher). These now ground the
MolecularFrequency node (index kind `m`/`mode`), with the imaginary-mode
convention fixed (imaginary serialized negative, n_imaginary the saddle-order
diagnostic). cm^-1 is a spectroscopic WAVENUMBER (nu-tilde = nu/c), the same
FREQUENCY dimension as the periodic Frequency only after the
omega = 2*pi*c*nu_tilde bridge: the map's canonical inverse_cm unit carries the
wavenumber directly (1 cm^-1 = 0.0299792458 linear THz), and the
angular-vs-wavenumber factor 2*pi*c stays a representation caveat, NOT a
dimension change.

Now UNBLOCKED: the molecular RRHO thermochemistry bundle (ZeroPointEnergy,
MolecularEnthalpy, MolecularGibbsEnergy, the T*S entropy correction) is the NEXT
named hook, freed because it needed the MolecularFrequency node first (the modes
drive the RRHO partition function). Still deferred with reasons: that RRHO bundle
itself (the next slice); DipoleMoment (Debye, a new charge*length dimension) and
NMRShift (ppm), neither surfaced by any parser (the agent reads
calculation.property.txt manually); SolvationFreeEnergy (rides TotalEnergy
provenance until a skill computes G_solv).
