r"""Operator nodes of the molecular domain.

Molecular quantum chemistry and reaction energetics, the map's FIRST molecular
code slice (AtomisticSkills arXiv 2605.24002: the ORCA quantum-chemistry skills
chem-dft-orca-{singlepoint,optimization,advanced-calculation} and the MLIP/chem
reaction skills chem-neb-barrier, chem-ts-optimization, chem-bond-dissociation).
Three ObservableSpaces, all scalar molecular energetics built on the per-MOLECULE
basis (a finite system with no periodic boundary conditions, no Brillouin zone),
distinct from the periodic per-cell energetics of the ground-state slice.

Node table:

  Node                          quantity tag              dimension  indices
  ----------------------------  ------------------------  ---------  -------
  HOMOLUMOGap                   homo_lumo_gap             ENERGY     ()
  ReactionBarrier[construction=  reaction_barrier          ENERGY     ()
    neb_mep]
  BondDissociationEnergy        bond_dissociation_energy  ENERGY     ()
  MolecularFrequency            molecular_frequency       FREQUENCY  (m)

MolecularFrequency arrives from the physics review (2026-07-10): the molecular
normal-mode axis, FREQUENCY dimension, indexed by mode number m (the registered
`mode` index kind, the named hook this slice's deferral pointed to). Its
imaginary-mode-negative serialization and n_imaginary saddle-order diagnostic
are the convention the deferral was waiting to fix; explicitly NOT the periodic
phonon (q, nu) Frequency.

The three energy nodes REUSE the plain ENERGY exponent vector (1,2,-2,0,0,0,0)
shared with
TotalEnergy, FormationEnergy, ReactionEnergy, and the other energy-difference
nodes: the dimension does NO separating work. Node identity is NAME-based
(omai/operator/space.py Space.__hash__/__eq__ hash on the node NAME, and the
derived quantity tag enters the identity hash), so each stays a distinct node
PURELY by carrying a fresh quantity tag, exactly as ConfigurationalEnergy and
ReactionEnergy stay distinct from TotalEnergy despite the shared exponent vector.

The per-molecule basis (load-bearing). ORCA total energies are all-electron (or
ECP) Gaussian-basis energies on the isolated-molecule energy zero, NOT the
pseudopotential zero of the periodic codes; an MLIP molecular energy is on the
per-element atom_refs zero. These molecular energetics must NEVER be numerically
subtracted against a periodic per-cell TotalEnergy nor across constructions; the
FORBIDDEN cross-substrate subtraction rule lives in the descriptions here and in
the rail notes, not in a composite identity key.

  * HOMOLUMOGap is the KS gap between two DISCRETE frontier molecular orbitals of
    a finite system. A COUSIN of the periodic BandGap (same ENERGY dimension, same
    KS-eigenvalue-gap family, same KS-not-quasiparticle and semilocal-functional
    caveats) but NEVER the same node: BandGap is VBM-to-CBM over the Brillouin
    zone, and a molecule has no bands, so equating them is a category error. Kept
    apart by its homo_lumo_gap tag.
  * ReactionBarrier is minted ONCE this slice as ReactionBarrier[construction=
    neb_mep], the CI-NEB minimum-energy-path barrier (chem-neb-barrier via ase.mep
    NEBTools.get_barrier, eV, MLIP). The construction LABEL_KEY carries the
    disambiguation: the sella static-TS (static_ts_mlip) and ORCA static-TS
    (static_ts_dft) routes join this ONE reaction_barrier family LATER without a
    re-mint (the carrier-label precedent: same tag, same dimension, distinct nodes
    only by the label). EMPHATICALLY DISTINCT from the Arrhenius ActivationEnergy
    (a diffusivity-slope, not a PES barrier, a tempting name collision).
  * BondDissociationEnergy is the energy to cleave one bond, a difference of
    relaxed fragment total energies. A LABELED SIBLING of the solid-state
    ReactionEnergy (both stoichiometric total-energy differences) but on the
    per-molecule basis, kept apart by its bond_dissociation_energy tag; kcal/mol
    is the chemist's native convention (the chem-bond-dissociation script truncates
    the eV->kcal/mol factor to 23.0605; record the exact 23.060547830619 on the
    encode side).

MolecularFrequency LANDED (physics review, 2026-07-10): the molecular
normal-mode axis is now a node (FREQUENCY, index m = the registered `mode`
kind), with the imaginary-mode convention fixed (imaginary modes serialized
NEGATIVE cm^-1, n_imaginary the saddle-order diagnostic). It is produced by
compute_molecular_frequencies (the mass-weighted-Hessian normal modes).

Deferred still (each with a named hook, so minting later is a clean add):

  * The molecular thermochemistry family (ZeroPointEnergy, MolecularEnthalpy,
    MolecularGibbsEnergy, the T*S entropy correction): per-molecule gas-phase RRHO
    ENERGY scalars, kept apart from the CALPHAD per-mole-of-atoms and phonon
    per-mole-of-cells nodes. This RRHO bundle is the NEXT named hook, now
    UNBLOCKED: it needed the MolecularFrequency node first (the modes drive the
    partition function), which this slice landed.
  * SolvationFreeEnergy, DipoleMoment, NMRShift: not surfaced by any parser today
    (the skills tag solvation on/off and read dipole/NMR from the property file
    manually), so deferred. Solvated single points ride TotalEnergy provenance.
