r"""Symbol-dimension registry of the materials domain.

Registered into the core registry (`omai.operator.dimcheck`) when
`omai.materials.operator` is imported, next to the vocabulary module.

Note the intentional cross-domain ``D``: here ``D`` is the self-diffusion
coefficient (diffusivity), whereas the thermal-transport domain's ``D`` is
the dynamical matrix, which thermal deliberately does NOT register.
Registration is global by base name, so this diffusivity registration
stands; the dimensional report supplies a per-edge ``local`` override that
blanks ``D``/``D^{bare}`` on the thermal DM-touching edges, so the two
never collide into a false violation.
