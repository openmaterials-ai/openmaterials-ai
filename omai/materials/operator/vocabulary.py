"""Formula symbol vocabulary of the materials domain.

Registered into the core registry (`omai.operator.vocabulary`) when
`omai.materials.operator` is imported. The MeanSquaredDisplacement entry
extends (unions with) the thermal-transport vocabulary for the shared
space: the fitted slope of MSD(t) is a trajectory-derived auxiliary
quantity the Einstein-relation edge references.
