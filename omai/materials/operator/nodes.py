CarrierDensity arrives from the physics review (2026-07-10, second supersede):
the L^-3 mobile-carrier number density n_c that makes the Nernst-Einstein ionic
conductivity executable (sigma = n_c z^2 e^2 D / (k_B T)). NEW dimension
NUMBER_DENSITY (0,-3,0,0,0,0,0) = 1/m^3, a pure inverse-volume. In the Diffusion
tier alongside Diffusivity and the ionic conductivity it feeds.

ElectricalConductivity[carrier=ionic] and ConfigurationalEnergy arrive from the
config-thermo scan (AtomisticSkills arXiv 2605.24002: pymatgen-analysis-diffusion
and smol).

The electric-current axis in the diffusion slice. ElectricalConductivity carries
the fresh ELECTRICAL_CONDUCTIVITY dimension (M=-1,L=-3,T=3,Theta=0,N=0,I=2,J=0),
the map's first I=+2 node and the first electric-current-axis node in the
diffusion slice (the materials-side Voltage at I=-1 already opened the axis, so
it is NOT the first current-axis node overall). It is EMPHATICALLY NOT the
thermal-transport ThermalConductivity (1,1,-3,-1,0,0,0): different L and T signs,
an I axis instead of a Theta axis, a distinct quantity that shares only the
English word "conductivity". The Nernst-Einstein ionic conductivity and the
already-mapped Diffusivity differ only by the number-density x z^2 e^2 / (k_B T)
conversion factor, so they are companions on the same axis.

The carrier label. The node is ElectricalConductivity[carrier=ionic]: the
carrier label (a new registered LABEL_KEY, collision-free against order,
bte_solver, transport_model, channel, wrt) keeps the ionic conductivity distinct
from the electronic sibling (carrier=electronic) that will join the same
ElectricalConductivity family from amset. Same tag and dimension, distinct nodes
only by the carrier label. Served scalar here (the skills report the scalar
extrapolated sigma_RT); the rank-2 tensor generalization sigma_{alpha,beta}
(conductivity_components) is a representation-layer packing, noted but not the
node's index signature.

ConfigurationalEnergy is a lattice-model (cluster-expansion) energy: plain ENERGY
(1,2,-2,0,0,0,0), the same exponent vector as TotalEnergy and FormationEnergy but
a DISTINCT quantity kept apart by the configurational_energy tag. It is the
energy smol's ClusterExpansion predicts for a configuration on a FIXED lattice
and FIXED cell (relax_cell=False), reference-shifted by the training set (total or
formation energy), NOT a relaxed-structure DFT/MLIP TotalEnergy and NOT a
per-atom FormationEnergy. The basis is a per-instance caveat (extensive per
supercell, per primitive cell with normalized=True, or per atom as the GCMC skill
reports), as is the ECI reference convention; both ride in the description and
instance conditions, not the dimension. The cluster-expansion checkpoint that
predicts it is a Potential-representation analog (an MLIP-checkpoint sibling),
recorded on the producing edge, not minted as a node here.
