"""The log-first versioned map store (kernel P3).

The map's source of truth is data, not Python: an append-only change log
(`log.jsonl`) plus a materialized current view (`current/nodes.json`,
`current/edges.json`) regenerated on every push, and a frozen genesis hash
(`GENESIS`). This module is the record / log / materialize / verify machinery
over a store directory.

Determinism is the load-bearing property. Every version hash is a pure
function of the record's content and the previous version hash (see
`omai.operator.identity.version_hash`); nothing here reads the clock or any
source of randomness. Dates always arrive from the caller.

The store is rebuildable from `log.jsonl` alone, without importing any omai
domain module: a record's payload carries the full identity dict and (for
edges) the formula srepr and display latex inline. `read()` replays the log;
`current/` is only a convenience mirror that `verify()` checks against the
replay.

Record shape (one canonical-JSON line per record in `log.jsonl`):

    {"seq", "op", "payload", "author", "date", "reason", "prev", "version"}

with `version = version_hash(prev, {every field except version})` and
`prev` = the previous record's version (genesis prev = 64 zeros).
