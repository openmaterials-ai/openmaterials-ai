"""The lineage layer: a light, lineage-identified, URL-first run record.

A lineage record is the shareable unit of a computation, and it is LIGHT: it
stores whatever we have of an experiment. The primary path is the lineage (the
map node when it is known, else a template plus its hyperparameters and setup
values), with NO fixed reproducibility guarantee and NO required heavy input
files. Heavy artifacts (structures, force sets, trajectories) are OPTIONAL and
POINTER-ONLY: an entry ``{path, role, url?, sha256?}`` where only ``path`` and
``role`` are required and a ``url`` (an MCG object, a Zenodo DOI) and its
``sha256`` are optional. A record with NO artifacts at all is valid and normal.
Identity comes from the LINEAGE, never from a per-artifact manifest.

The record is URL-FIRST: :func:`record_to_fragment` gzip+base64url-encodes a
light record into a link fragment, exactly the scheme the map-view sharing in
``docs/play/index.html`` uses (a ``g`` gzip prefix, base64url, ``=`` stripped),
so an experiment IS a link that opens in the openmaterials playground under
``#x=`` and, when its lineage names a map node, lights that node on the map. A
Python-produced fragment and a browser-produced one interoperate.

This is deliberately a two-tier design. OpenMaterials is the open FORMAT (this
data structure, host-agnostic); MaterialsCodeGraph (MCG) is the cheap host for
the heavy bytes, referenced by pointer, never embedded in identity. The heavy,
byte-verifiable path (:func:`record_from_bundle` over a checksummed bundle,
:func:`verify_bundle_bytes` over its bytes) still exists as an OPTIONAL
enrichment for when a full manifest DOES exist and someone wants byte
verification; it is no longer the primary path, and it no longer refuses a
bundle whose artifacts lack a sha256 (those become pointers, outside identity).

Records live in ``docs/data/simulations/<slug>.json`` when written, never on the
map page itself. The structural siblings are the value, configuration, and
spectrum records.

Identity (the content-addressing rule, this module's protocol commitment):

    record_id = sha256 of the canonical JSON of exactly the LINEAGE. Identity is
    the asked computation, nothing else. The lineage is the map ``node`` (with a
    ``node_uid`` pin when a map node is known, else absent), the ``material``,
    the ``template`` (the code family, when there is no map node), the
    ``conditions``, ``params``, ``hyperparameters``, and setup ``values``.
    Everything else a record carries is OUTSIDE the hash: ``execution`` (what
    ran: code, version, seeds, wall time), ``artifacts`` (the optional pointer
    list), ``mirrors`` (the resolver), and ``results``. This is deliberate: an
    experiment's identity must not change when you attach a trajectory pointer,
    move its bytes to a new MCG url, re-run it on a different pod, or bundle the
    values it produced. Two records with the same lineage are the same
    experiment; a different node, material, template, condition, param,
    hyperparameter, or setup value is a different one.

    Artifacts NEVER enter identity. An artifact is a pointer
    ``{path, role, url?, sha256?}``, and even its sha256 is a claim about bytes
    for verification, not a component of the lineage id. Adding, removing, or
    re-hosting an artifact pointer leaves the record id unchanged. ``results``
    is likewise outside: a result instance carries the record id as its
    ``simulation`` backref, so it cannot sit inside the payload that mints that
    id (a circular reference).

Canonicalization (the configurations precedent, extended to the lineage): sorted
keys, compact separators, and an explicit float rule. Every float inside
``conditions``, ``params``, ``hyperparameters``, and ``values`` (at any nesting
depth) is rounded to :data:`FLOAT_DECIMALS` decimals before hashing, so
refetch-level numerical noise in a shared lineage collapses to one identity while
physically distinct runs stay apart; booleans and integers are preserved
exactly. Because identity is the lineage alone, there is no float anywhere else
in the hashed payload. The canonical blob is
``json.dumps(lineage, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"))`` and the id is its
sha256; this rule is a protocol commitment, not an implementation detail.

Validation (gate-shaped, cheap, deterministic, and HONEST about gaps): the light
validator holds a lineage to "whatever we have". When the lineage names a ``node``,
it must resolve against the live map by BOTH id and content uid (the instances
node-pin discipline: a stale pin is a mismatch, not a silent pass); when it does
NOT, the record is valid and simply carries its template plus values, FLAGGED as
node-unresolved rather than rejected (the honesty rule). Artifact pointers, when
present, must be well-formed: ``path`` and ``role`` non-empty, ``url`` a string
if present, ``sha256`` a 64-hex string if present; nothing about artifacts is
mandatory. The heavy validator (:func:`_validate`) additionally checks the
execution block and any named configuration and result instances, for the
enrichment path that carries them.

Verification (a report, NEVER a gate): :func:`verify_simulation` checks the
mirrors for reachability and checksum match when URLs are present and returns a
dated report. A mirror entry may carry an optional free-form ``provider`` string
naming who holds the bytes (e.g. "materialscodegraph", "zenodo"), outside
identity like the rest of the mirror layer and echoed onto the report; the
commons standardizes the key, not a registry of values. A record whose bytes
moved or whose mirror is down is stale, not invalid; the map owns identity, MCG
owns the bytes.

The heavy import/verify path (an OPTIONAL enrichment): :func:`record_from_bundle`
maps a hosted MCG-style bundle manifest onto the record shape and mints the same
lineage-derived id. It does NOT require checksums: an artifact carrying a sha256
is kept as a verifiable pointer, one lacking a sha256 becomes a plain pointer
(``{path, role, url?}``, outside identity exactly like the light path), and the
id comes from the lineage regardless. :func:`verify_bundle_bytes` then reports
(never gates) whether each artifact's bytes match its checksum when a checksum is
present and the bytes are locally or fetchably reachable. A full checksummed
bundle therefore ENRICHES a record with verifiable bytes but is never REQUIRED.

The share ENVELOPE (multi-lineage bundles): one link can carry SEVERAL records
plus shared document context. :func:`envelope` builds
``{"v": 1, "doc"?: {...}, "lineages": [record, ...]}`` (``doc`` is publication
metadata for a parsed paper: ``source`` as a "scheme:ref" string, ``title``,
``authors``, ``year``, ``journal``, extras tolerated);
:func:`envelope_to_fragment` / :func:`envelope_from_fragment` are the transport
(same gzip+base64url+mode-prefix scheme, unchanged). The read side is DUAL:
:func:`envelope_from_fragment` also accepts every legacy bare-record fragment,
normalizing it to a one-element envelope with no doc, so no existing link ever
breaks. Each member keeps its own lineage-derived id (bundling never re-mints
one); the BUNDLE gets a derived :func:`bundle_id`, the sha256 of the canonical
JSON of ``{"doc": doc-or-null, "ids": [member ids in order]}``. A member with
no source inherits ``doc.source`` at read/display time only, never into its
hash: sharing a record solo or inside a bundle mints the same id.

Entry points: :func:`record_light` (build a light, lineage-identified record; the
primary builder), :func:`record_to_fragment` / :func:`record_from_fragment` (the
URL round-trip, interoperable with the playground's gzip fragment),
:func:`envelope` / :func:`bundle_id` / :func:`envelope_to_fragment` /
:func:`envelope_from_fragment` (the multi-lineage share bundle),
:func:`record_simulation` (write a record to ``docs/data/simulations/``,
idempotent on identical content, refusing a silent overwrite, the
``record_instance`` discipline), :func:`record_from_bundle` (build a record from
a hosted bundle, checksums optional), :func:`verify_simulation` /
:func:`verify_bundle_bytes` (the dated reports). Bundling into
``docs/data/simulations.json`` lives in :mod:`omai.map_data`
(``build_simulations``), mirroring the other record kinds.

    LINEAGE alone (:func:`lineage_id`); everything else rides outside the hash.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lineage : dict
        The asked computation. Recognized keys (all optional except that the
        lineage must be a non-empty object): ``node`` (a map node id, present when
        a map node is known) with an optional ``node_uid`` pin; ``material``;
        ``template`` (the code family, the honest fallback when there is no map
        node); ``conditions``; ``params``; ``hyperparameters``; setup ``values``.
        Floats in conditions/params/hyperparameters/values are rounded to
        :data:`FLOAT_DECIMALS` for identity.
    execution : dict | None
        Optional "what ran": ``code``, ``code_version``, ``seeds``,
        ``wall_time_s``, whatever is known. Outside identity. When present it
        must name a non-empty ``code`` (the execution well-formedness bar).
    artifacts : list[dict] | None
        Optional POINTER list, each ``{path, role, url?, sha256?}``. Only path
        and role are required; url/sha256 are optional and never hashed. A record
        with no artifacts is valid and normal.
    mirrors : dict | None
        Optional resolver layer (path -> {url, ...}). Outside identity. A mirror
        entry may carry an optional free-form ``provider`` string naming who
        holds the bytes (e.g. "materialscodegraph", "zenodo").
    results : list | None
        Optional results (backref slugs or instance stubs). Outside identity.
    name_to_uid : dict | None
        Precomputed node-id -> uid map. Consulted when the lineage names a node
        (to pin the live uid and validate) or when ``results`` is given (to
        validate a result stub's variable); built from the live map on demand
        when omitted and needed. A node-less lineage with no results never
        builds the map.
    domains : tuple | None
        Domains to build ``name_to_uid`` from when the lineage names a node and no
        map was supplied (default: the live map).
    config_dir : Path | None
        Deprecated: a directory of configuration records the configuration
        pin may also resolve in, beside ``roots``.
    roots : list[Path] | None
        Where cited configuration and model uids resolve (default:
        ``docs/data/`` in a source tree, the registry the wheel ships in an
        installed package).
    unregistered : list[dict] | None
        ``[{kind, uid}]``: each cited configuration or model uid that no root
        registers. Outside identity; omitted when None or empty.
    lineage_version, overlay_version : str | None
        The map version the record was made against, and the private overlay
        it used (0.2.1). Outside identity; omitted when None.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        The record: ``{id, lineage, execution?, artifacts?, mirrors?, results?,
        unregistered?, lineage_version?, overlay_version?}``.
        ``artifacts`` is included (possibly empty) so a consumer sees the (light)
        manifest explicitly; ``execution``/``mirrors``/``results`` appear only
        when given.

    Raises
    ------
    LineageError
        On a malformed lineage, a stale node pin, an unresolved configuration
        pin, a malformed pointer, or (when present) a malformed
        execution/result.

        The strict manifest: each entry ``{path, bytes, sha256, role}`` (this

        ``url`` is dropped from the stored row and preserved only if declared in

        The run's instances as backref slugs (strings) or inline stubs (dicts
        carrying ``simulation == <this record id>``). Outside the hashed claim.
        A slug is accepted bare here (its instance may land after the record
        does); the bundler resolves it against docs/data/instances/ and
        requires the instance to backref this record.
    mirrors : dict | None
        The mutable resolver layer, keyed by artifact path -> {url, ...} (or any
        location metadata). Outside the hashed claim: moving bytes never
        re-mints the id.
    domains : tuple | None
        Domains to resolve the lineage node and result variables against
        (default: the live map).
    sim_dir : Path | None
        Override the default docs/data/simulations directory (tests).
    name_to_uid : dict | None
        Precomputed node-id -> uid map (tests); built from ``domains`` if omitted.
    roots, unregistered, lineage_version, overlay_version
        As in :func:`record_light`.

    Returns
    -------
    Path
        The written record's path. Idempotent on identical content (the same

    The reciprocal of a host's export: takes an MCG-style bundle manifest (keys

    pointers, but it is never required: this path no longer refuses a bundle
    whose artifacts lack a sha256.

    The mapping (honest, never inventing what the bundle did not carry):

    - ``lineage`` comes from ``template`` + ``spec`` (:func:`_lineage_from_bundle`).
      If the spec names a map ``node`` (and optionally ``material``,
      ``conditions``, ``params``, a ``node_uid`` pin), those are lifted so the
      lineage resolves against the live map; the spec is always kept verbatim
      under ``lineage.spec``. A spec that names no node yields a record with
      ``lineage.node`` ABSENT, which validation reports (node-unresolved) rather
      than the writer guessing a node id.
    - ``execution`` comes from ``template`` (or an explicit ``code``) plus the
      run's ``started_at`` / ``finished_at`` / ``current_stage``;
      ``wall_time_s`` is derived only when both timestamps parse as ISO, else
      omitted (:func:`_execution_from_bundle`). Outside identity.
    - ``artifacts`` are the bundle's entries as POINTERS
      (:func:`_bundle_artifacts`): one carrying a ``sha256`` stays a verifiable
      pointer, one lacking a sha256 becomes a plain pointer, and NONE enters the
      hash. A missing role defaults to ``"artifact"``. No artifact is required.
    - ``mirrors`` (optional) is the resolver layer (where the bytes are hosted),
      outside identity; a mirrored url is copied onto the matching pointer as a
      reader convenience.
    - ``outputs`` (the bundle's headline result JSON) rides along as provenance
      OUTSIDE identity: it is what the run produced, not the lineage it was asked,
      and it is raw stage JSON, not a validated instance stub, so it is not filed
      under ``results``. ``name`` and ``kind`` likewise ride as provenance.

    ----------
    manifest : dict
        The host bundle manifest (the MCG export shape).
    mirrors : dict | None
        The optional resolver layer, keyed by artifact path -> {url, ...}.
        Outside identity: adding or moving a url never re-mints the id.
    name_to_uid : dict | None
        Precomputed node-id -> uid map (tests); built from the live map if
