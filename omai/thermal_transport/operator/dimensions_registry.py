r"""Symbol-dimension registry of the thermal-transport domain.

Registers, into the core registry (`omai.operator.dimcheck`), the physical
dimension of each unambiguous sympy base symbol the domain's edge formulas
use. Imported for its side effect by
`omai.thermal_transport.operator.__init__`, next to the vocabulary module,
so any consumer of the domain's edges can run the dimensional gate.

Discipline: never guess a symbol's dimension. Symbols whose base name is
ambiguous across two physical quantities are deliberately left
unregistered, which makes any edge that needs them SKIPPED (unknown), not
wrongly flagged. The intentionally-skipped symbols and why:

  * ``M``          - both the atomic-mass IndexedBase (mass) and the MSD
                     field symbol (length^2); registering either is wrong
                     for the other. Left unknown.
  * ``e``          - both the phonon eigenvector (dimensionless) and the
                     per-mode internal-energy field (energy). Ambiguous
                     globally, so left unregistered; edges touching the
                     InternalEnergy / MolarInternalEnergy spaces resolve it
                     to ENERGY via a per-edge ``local`` override in dimcheck
                     (eigenvectors never enter those formulas).
  * ``g``          - both the phonon DOS and the isotope mass-variance
                     factor. Ambiguous.
  * ``D``, ``D^{bare}`` - the dynamical matrix. Its field dimension is
                     frequency *squared* (the mass-weighted Hessian, whose
                     eigenvalues are omega^2: the dispersion equation reads
                     ``Sum(D e) = omega^2 e``), so the DynamicalMatrix /
                     BareDynamicalMatrix fields declare FREQUENCY_SQUARED.
                     The base name ``D`` is NOT registered globally here
                     because the materials domain registers ``D`` as
                     diffusivity (a different physical D) and the global
                     registry holds one dimension per base name. The two
                     never collide because dimcheck supplies a per-edge
                     ``local`` override binding ``D``/``D^{bare}`` to
                     FREQUENCY_SQUARED on the thermal DM-touching edges,
                     while materials edges keep the global diffusivity ``D``.
  * ``Jcorr``, ``Cv`` - the heat-current ACF and velocity-ACF kinds are
                     declared OPAQUE on their spaces; opaque never enters
                     algebra.
