"""Quantum ESPRESSO adapter specs for the thermal-transport DAG.

QE grounds the SOURCE tier of the DAG: where kaldo / phono3py / ShengBTE
consume force constants, Born charges, and dielectric tensors as given,
QE is the code that produces them from first principles (DFPT linear
response). The mapped chain is pw.x (SCF) -> ph.x (DFPT at q; Z*, eps_inf
at q=0) -> q2r.x (real-space FC2) -> matdyn.x (interpolation, NAC,
frequencies, DOS, eigenvectors).

Derived from the scan catalog `scans/qe-phonon.json` (QE 7.5, every entry
anchored to file:line in the vendored q-e/ tree). Output-file mapping:

Convention traps this module pins down (see scans/qe-phonon.md for the
full list with source anchors):

  * QE "dynamical matrix" files hold RAW force constants at q, in
    Ry/bohr^2: never mass-weighted, and (in fildyn) never NAC-corrected.
    Mass division by amu_ry*sqrt(m_a m_b) happens only at diagonalization
    (PHonon/PH/dyndia.f90:74, rigid.f90:452). The operator-layer
    DynamicalMatrix is the mass-weighted frequency^2 form, so per-element
    comparison against another code requires applying the mass weighting
    first; the specs below record that as a note rather than pretending a
    scalar unit factor exists.
  * Mass units flip with file format: text dyn/flfrc store amu*911.444
    (Rydberg atomic mass units, io_dyn_mat_old.f90:78, matdyn.f90:965);
    the XML variants store plain amu (io_dyn_mat.f90:95); input namelists
    take amu.
  * For polar solids flfrc is SHORT-RANGE ONLY: q2r subtracts the Gonze
    dipole-dipole term (do_q2r.f90:260) and matdyn re-adds it
    (matdyn.f90:1280) plus the q->0 non-analytic term. Comparing flfrc to
    a phonopy FORCE_CONSTANTS file verbatim is wrong whenever Z* != 0.
  * Frequencies are LINEAR (nu, not omega): ph.x prints THz and cm^-1
    side by side; matdyn.freq is cm^-1 only. Negative value = imaginary
    mode (omega^2 < 0).

FC3 is out of QE's tree: the D3Q plugin produces it (the qe-d3q representation,
qe_d3q.py), as does thirdorder.py for ShengBTE. Heat capacity, group
velocities, linewidths, and kappa are not produced by this slice: the
BTE-solving codes consume QE's outputs and produce those downstream.
