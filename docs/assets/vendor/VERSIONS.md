# Vendored assets

Every third-party asset the public site depends on is committed here so the
site makes zero external requests at runtime (the one allowed exception is the
Learn page's user-initiated BYO-key call to `api.anthropic.com`, whose SDK is
itself vendored below). Downloaded from the official jsDelivr npm CDN and
Google Fonts at build time.

## Modifications made for self-containment

- **KaTeX CSS**: the `@font-face` `src` lists were trimmed to the `.woff2`
  format only (the `.woff` and `.ttf` fallbacks were dropped, and those files
  are not vendored). Every current browser supports woff2. 20 woff2 faces are
  vendored under `katex/dist/fonts/`. The files keep the canonical npm `dist/`
  layout (`dist/katex.min.js`, `dist/katex.min.css`, `dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js`,
  `dist/fonts/`) so the reveal.js math plugin resolves them from a single
  `katex: { local: '.../vendor/katex' }` config.
- **Anthropic SDK**: the jsDelivr `+esm` bundles re-import their dependencies
  from `/npm/...` at runtime, which would defeat standalone. The import
  specifiers were rewritten to local relative paths:
  `sdk.mjs` -> `./standardwebhooks.mjs`; `standardwebhooks.mjs` ->
  `./fast-sha256.mjs` and `./stablelib-base64.mjs`. The two leaf modules have
  no further imports. The message-creation path the Learn page uses
  (`new Anthropic(...).messages.create`) does not touch the webhook code, but
  the dependency is vendored intact rather than stubbed so the SDK stays whole.
- **Inter**: only the `latin` and `latin-ext` subsets are vendored (all five
  weights). The `@font-face` rules keep their original `unicode-range`
  descriptors, so non-latin ranges simply fall back to the system stack; all
  site copy and physics symbols are covered by latin/latin-ext.
- **Source Serif 4 / JetBrains Mono**: the `latin` subset only (the css2
  `U+0000-00FF ...` range that covers all site copy). Each weight is a **static
  per-weight instance** (fetched via a legacy user-agent so Google serves a
  distinct baked-weight woff2 rather than a shared variable slice); this keeps
  the exact weights the brief specifies without shipping the full variable font.
  Source Serif 4 is display-only (headings/wordmark); JetBrains Mono is the data
  voice (hashes, ids, code, stat numerals). JetBrains Mono ships a dotted zero
  by default, so the `font-feature-settings:"zero" 1` on the mono token is a
  no-op passthrough rather than a functional glyph toggle.

- **3d-force-graph**: the official jsDelivr `dist/3d-force-graph.min.js` UMD
  bundle. It embeds its own copy of three.js (the WebGL renderer, cameras, and
  sprite/canvas-texture classes are all inside), so the 3D map page needs only
  this one file, no separate three vendoring. The bundle exposes a single
  `ForceGraph3D` global and does not re-export `THREE`; the 3D map page therefore
  encodes node symbols with the library's built-in `nodeLabel` hover overlay
  (plain-string, KaTeX-free) rather than custom three text sprites, keeping the
  page to this one script with zero external fetches.

Total committed vendored size: ~4.9 MB (3d-force-graph adds ~1.28 MB).
